## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a software engineer who enjoys working where artificial intelligence, backend engineering and research meet.  
I like taking ideas from notes and Figma boards into working systems that people can actually use, not just classroom demos.

I am currently:

- Building AI and ML projects that focus on practical use cases  
- Designing backend services that are simple to reason about and easy to extend  
- Doing academic research where computing supports real world decisions  
- Writing and sharing what I learn so that other people can move faster

Outside code I enjoy teaching, community work and collaborating with other builders.
